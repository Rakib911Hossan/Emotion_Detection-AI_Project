# Emotion_Detection-AI_Project
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model 
- capable of classifying text into eight distinct emotion categories: joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, neutral, disgust, and shame.

Emotion detection from text is a challenging NLP task that involves analyzing written content to classify it into specific emotional categories such as joy, sadness, anger, or fear. While humans can easily interpret emotions from text, automating this process requires robust machine-learning models due to complexities like slang, sarcasm, and varying linguistic styles. 

This project aims to develop a model that accurately predicts emotions from short text inputs, which can be useful in applications like mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and AI-driven chatbots.

The primary challenge lies in handling an imbalanced dataset, where some emotions (e.g., joy, sadness) are overrepresented, while others (e.g., shame, disgust) have very few samples. Additionally, raw text data contains noise such as user mentions (@), stopwords, and informal language, which can degrade model performance. The goal is to preprocess the text effectively, train a reliable classifier, and evaluate its ability to generalize across different emotions.

Three machine learning models—Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest—were tested to determine the best approach. The selected model must balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability while addressing class imbalance and noisy text. The final solution should provide a deployable system for real-world emotion detection tasks.

Future enhancements could include deep learning techniques (e.g., BERT, LSTM) and better handling of rare emotions through resampling or weighted loss functions. This project serves as a foundation for more advanced emotion recognition systems in NLP.
